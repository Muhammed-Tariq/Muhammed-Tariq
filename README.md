## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Muhammed.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to learn how to build a website! If I'm successful, you should see something [here](http://muhammedtariq.com/).
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m perpetually swamped with schoolwork, although I try to do good things with my time. This is one example!
- ðŸ“« You can reach me:
  - on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammed5371/);
  - through email, at `@seriauora@gmail.com`;
  - or through my Discord, `@seriaura`.
